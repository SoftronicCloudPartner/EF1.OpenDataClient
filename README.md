EF1 Open Data example website

 In order to increase the transparency of data created by municipalities, we have created, in collaboration with Vinnova,
    a platform for open data in the form of diarium and vendor invoices.
    The client is published here in the form of open source code which create conditions to adapt the APIs to local requirements and the possibility for
    innovators to create new types of transparency App:s on this type of information.
    
This project is a website demonstrating one way of visualize data from an OData Service.
The website uses Javascript libraries to consume API:s through the OData protocol.
